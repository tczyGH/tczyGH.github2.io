# Toby’s Canadian French Toast

My Mom made delicious French toast as I was growing up. I’ve adapted her recipe. French toast is great for breakfast! 
Makes 4-6 servings. Total preparation time 20-30 min.

## Ingredients
* 1 loaf of day-old bread (type of bread is optional; egg loaf works best)
* 6 eggs
* milk (4 cups)
* butter (150 ml)
* salt (1/4 tsp)
* vanilla extract (1 tsp)

### Toppings (choose one or more!)
* fresh fruit
* maple syrup
* sour cream
* jam

## Equipment
* frying pan
* large pan or bowl
* spatula (heat resistant)
* fork or whisk 
* serving dish with cover
* plates for serving

## Preparation
1.	Slice day-old bread into 1- inch slices.
2.	In a large pan or bowl, combine milk, eggs, vanilla, and salt. Stir with a fork or whisk until well mixed.
3.	Add slices to the liquid mixture, making sure that all the slices are covered by liquid on both sides.
4.	Let slices soak for a few minutes. 
        If your bowl’s not big enough for all the slices, you can soak some slices while other slices are cooking.

## Cooking
1.	Melt about half of the butter in a frying pan on medium heat, just until sizzling.
2.	Add the soaked bread slices.
3.	Press each slice down gently with a spatula to flatten it.
4.	With the spatula, lift each slice occasionally to check if it’s browned.
5.	Add the remainder of the butter gradualy, as needed, to keep the slices from sticking to the pan.
5.	When a slice is browned on one side, flip it over.
6.	When a slice is browned on the second side, remove it from the frying pan and place it in a serving dish.
7.	Keep slices warm in a covered serving dish, until all slices are ready.

## Serving 
1.	Serve a warm few slices on each plate, with the preferred topping.
2.	Enjoy!!
